# NotesPasswordManager

## Objective
An application which helps to take notes at anytime and helps to generate a very strong password for security of your account and makes them available whenever you need. It's going to have two major functionalities at the same time.

## Context
Password managing & note taking are one of the most overlooked virtual activities in today's digital age. 
So, instead of having and maintaining two different apps in your system, we'll be developing a single app which can perform both of these activities.
